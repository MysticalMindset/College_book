- Notes organized by year and subject/module  
- Summaries, key concepts, and important formulas  
- Diagrams, examples, and breakdowns where helpful  
- Consistently formatted for easy reading and quick reference

Most files are in **Markdown**, **PDF**, or **DOCX**, depending on the course and what made the most sense at the time.
